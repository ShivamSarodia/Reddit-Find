Reddit-Find
==============

Reddit Find is a lightweight extension indicating the presence of comment threads for any webpage, such as a news article, comic, or image. When the site you're browsing has been discussed on reddit, the extension icon turns blue, directly connecting you to others' comments on the topic.
